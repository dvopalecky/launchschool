# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.
# http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/chapter_one -> seems like a nice step by step guide
# https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api -> OK
# http://api.rubyonrails.org/ -> seems unintuitive for beginner, but probably good for documentation
